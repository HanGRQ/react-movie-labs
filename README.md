Name: Sihan Ma

## Overview.

This repository contains a ReactJS application developed as part of Assignment 1. The app leverages the TMDB API to display various movie-related features. It incorporates advanced functionality such as filtering, sorting, pagination, responsive design, and third-party authentication using Firebase. The application meets all 12 requirements outlined in the assignment specification.

## Independent learning.

This project required independent research and implementation of several new concepts and technologies not covered in the course. These include:

1. **React Query**:
   - Used to fetch and cache data from TMDB API endpoints.
   - Files: `api/tmdb-api.js`, `favoriteMoviesPage.js`, `templateMoviePage.js`
   - References: 
     - [React Query Documentation](https://react-query.tanstack.com/)

2. **Firebase Authentication**:
   - Implemented Google login and logout functionality using Firebase.
   - Files: `contexts/authContext.js`, `loginPage.js`
   - References:
     - [Firebase Authentication Documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth)

3. **Material-UI Components**:
   - Added advanced components like Accordion, Tabs, and Paper for better UI/UX.
   - Files: `filterMoviesCard.js`, `templateMovieListPage.js`
   - References:
     - [Material-UI Documentation](https://mui.com/)

4. **Responsive Layouts**:
   - Ensured all components and pages are responsive using Material-UI's Grid system.
   - Files: `templateMoviePage.js`, `pageTemplate.js`
   - References:
     - [Responsive Grid Documentation](https://mui.com/system/grid/)

5. **Dynamic Layout Management**:
   - Added logic to handle dynamic empty slot management for pages like favorites.
   - Files: `templateMoviePage.js`, `favoriteMoviesPage.js`
